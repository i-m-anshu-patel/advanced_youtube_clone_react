If you’re looking to build your credit without adding debt, check out the Experian Smart Money Debit Card and Digital Checking Account. \n\nIn this episode, we’ve got to start with a huge thank you to the over thirty-six thousand of you who entered our first-ever bracket challenge, a full breakdown of Jason becoming the most beloved drive-through customer at McDonald’s, and a reaction to Chris Jones discovering that no one has ever said “Kelce” right. \n\nTravis recaps everything that happened ON the field in Buffalo including his thoughts on Patrick Mahomes' first road playoff performance, breaking a Gronk playoff record, why he owes Mecole Hardman an apology, and what he said to Josh Allen in the tunnel at halftime. \n\nAnd you know we gotta talk about it. Jason breaks down everything that happened during his time with Bill’s mafia. We touch on everything from what he drank from the bowling ball, what Kylie thought of his decision to go shirtless, and if this was the perfect way to make a first impression. \n\nWe also recap everything else that went down during the divisional round including the Ravens suffocating win over Houston, the Lions, and the Niners pulling out a win against the Packers. \n\nWe will be back Friday with a preview of the Chiefs AFC Championship game in Baltimore and a full breakdown of the second round of our “Best Team Name” bracket challenge. \n\nMake sure you’re subscribed to the New Heights YouTube Channel and wherever you get your podcasts so you don’t miss out and follow us on Instagram, Twitter, and TikTok for all the best moments from the show.\n.\n.\n.\nDownload the full podcast here:\nApple: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/new-heights/id1643745036\nSpotify:https://open.spotify.com/show/1y3SUbFMUSESC1N43tBleK?si=LsuQ4a5MRN6wGMcfVcuynw\n\n\nFollow New Heights on Social Media: \nhttp://hoo.be/newheightshow\n\nSupport the Show:  \n\nSupport the Show:  \nMerch - Make sure you check out all the new designs at https://homage.com/newheights\n\nPRIZEPICKS - Go to https://PrizePicks.com/newheights and use code NEWHEIGHTS for a first deposit match up to $100 \n\nEXPERIAN: To get your Experian Smart Money Debit Card and Digital Checking Account go to https://Experian.com/Kelce.

That results in a lot of funny moments that I don't really want to go to waste. Here are some of the extra clips that I got for the Huntsman episode, along with some extra Behind the Scenes goodies! Well, sort of - thing is, I have so many behind-the-scenes topics to talk about, and so much extra huntsman footage, that this video’s scope ballooned out into something I couldn’t manage to get out by the end of the month. So this video is just the behind-the-scenes stuff, and I’m working on the extra clips now - I’ll hopefully drop that some time in February.

That results in a lot of funny moments that I don't really want to go to waste. Here are some of the extra clips that I got for the Huntsman episode, along with some extra Behind the Scenes goodies! Well, sort of - thing is, I have so many behind-the-scenes topics to talk about, and so much extra huntsman footage, that this video’s scope ballooned out into something I couldn’t manage to get out by the end of the month. So this video is just the behind-the-scenes stuff, and I’m working on the extra clips now - I’ll hopefully drop that some time in February.
